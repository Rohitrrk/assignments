Implicit conversions: PL/SQL attempts to convert data types dynamically if they are mixed in a statement. Consider the following example:
DECLARE
 v_salary NUMBER(6):=6000;
 v_sal_hike VARCHAR2(5):='1000';
 v_total_salary v_salary%TYPE;
BEGIN
 v_total_salary:=v_salary + v_sal_hike;
END;/


Implicit conversions can be between: 
Characters and numbers
Characters and dates

Explicit conversions: To convert values from one data type to another, use built-in functions. For example, to convert a CHAR value to a DATE or NUMBER value, use TO_DATE or TO_NUMBER, respectively.
