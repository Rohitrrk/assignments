ans 3.4:
The algorithm is computing the sum of the n elements starting from 1 to the n which is taken as input.

efficiency class of the algorithm is o(n)
as per the formula :
i=l to u  summation of (l=u-l+l)
where u is initial condition of the loop and l is final condition,
hence ,
i=l to n summation of (l=n-l+l)
hence we get ,
i=l to n summation of (l=n)
therefore efficiency of the algorithm is O(n)
