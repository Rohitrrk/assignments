1. Algorithm is finding the smallest and largest element of array and storing it in x and y respectively and returning the  difference between them
2.in the algorithm x and y storers the element at the 0 th position of the array as the initial condition for n-2 iterations element stored in x is compared
 with it similarity element stored on y is compared with the element in the array for n-2 iterations , the largest element is stored in y for every
 comparisonand between the basic operation executes n-1  times .it depends on the size of arraygiven as input by useeeer
 suppose n=7 A[7]=[10,12,1,5,15,6]
 then
 i  A[I] X  Y
 1  10  10 10
 2  12 10  12
 3  1  1   12
 4  5  1   12
 5  15 1   15
